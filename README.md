<h1>Handwritten Digit Recognition</h1>
<br/>
This project is about classifying images which shows handwritten digits and calculating the accuracy with our training model and the labels which are already defined in the dataset.
The process is done by creating a neural network which contains input layer, hidden layer and an output layer.
The dataset used here is <b>MNIST</b>.
